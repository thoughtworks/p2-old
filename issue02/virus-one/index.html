    <div class="article-body"><p>It&rsquo;s 1990. I&rsquo;m in year 8, and as I&rsquo;m walking across the dismal asphalt quadrangle toward the ash-grey public-school building I can see something is wrong. Shane Cooper is yelling something at me and laughing. He&rsquo;s shouting to be heard: whatever it is he&rsquo;s telling me, he wants everyone to know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Infected! You&rsquo;re infected! A Virus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s taunting me. I can feel the faces of the schoolyard swivelling toward me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;1990. This is back before public internet existed. Before ISP&rsquo;s. Shane, and a  few others of us at school were swapping pirated floppy discs. 5 and a ¼ inches of excitement. We&rsquo;re mates. Spacequest, stuff like that. I run it on my x86 at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As geeks,  we&rsquo;re largely invisible in the overall social structure, but I&rsquo;m big news in geekland.  I know stuff about computers that isn&rsquo;t general knowledge.  I can write BASIC.  I&rsquo;ve hex-edited my name into the copyright strings of my command interpreter, by editing the disk sectors with DiskEdit.</p>

<p>At home, I get my first piece of antivirus software: virus scan for DOS. The x86 had no permanent storage at all. No hard disc. That fact changed my life. The virus had been transmitted through my entire collection of 5 ¼&#8221; discs.</p>

<p>I disinfected all my 5 and a ¼ inch floppy discs.</p>

<p>Well, all except one. To this day I don&rsquo;t know why I did it. I had a floppy disc storage box &ndash; like an index card file system. And at the very back, I left one infected disc. Like an unexploded landmine.</p>

<p>Looking back,  now I realise this is one in a series of events that changed my life.  Because my 8086 had no permanent storage at all.  No hard disc.   It meant I was never afraid to &lsquo;trash&rsquo; my computer, since a &lsquo;trashing&rsquo; was never persistent.  I could simply toss the trashed floppy disk, reboot clean, and go again.</p>

<p>This is the moment is where it all started with me and security testing. The moment I quietly slid that dull grey object into the back of my filing box. Curiosity, hooking me in.</p>

<p>It sat there for a while. I don&rsquo;t know. Weeks, Months. Until, feeling the pull of curiosity, one morning I pulled it out again. I had been turning the problem over in my mind. I thought the virus must live in the boot sector somewhere.</p>

<p>I run PCTools Deluxe DiskEdit and paged through the hex of the boot sector, no longer just a computer user. Looking for something malevolent. I don&rsquo;t know what. DiscEdit gives you two panes: In the centre: 16 columns of pure hex. And on the right, the ASCII equivalent. Black on white, like in the movies.</p>

<p>There. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. Right there, on the right-hand side:</p>

<p>A message from the authors&hellip; From Pakistan!   In a time before internet, this piece of self-replicating code had taken four years to jump from floppy disk, to floppy disk.  Probably hitching rides with people in cars.  Buses.  Trains.  Planes.  All the way to the middle-class suburbs of Geelong.  My bedroom.  These guys had reached around from the edges of the world, and were talking to me.</p>

<p>What I didn&rsquo;t know then, that I know now: The brothers in Lahore had started two industries: the virus industry and the antivirus industry. And the arms race between them had begun.</p>
